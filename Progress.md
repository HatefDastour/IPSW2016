\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are two groups of Borrowers: Group 1 (Financial firms) and Group 2 (Oil and Gas); each group has a large number of firms (around 1000).
\item Each borrower is ranked based on expert opinions. A rank is a number between 1 and 16 (default banks have rank 17). The bank has monthly data on ranks over a period of 10 years for each borrower.
\item If two borrowers belong to the same group, it is straightforward to compare the riskiness of these (by comparing the average scores for instance). 

\begin{frame}{Problem setting}
\item Problem: If there are two borrowers coming from different groups, how can the bank know which borrower is riskier?
\item We then need to find a global ranking scale to compare the riskiness amongst borrowers from either groups.
\end{itemize}
